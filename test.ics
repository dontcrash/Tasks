DESCRIPTION:This exercise has been designed to assist preparation for Pract
 ical 1: THE CONCEPT OF LIGHT MICROSCOPY. Concepts and skills that are cove
 red here are vital to understand and complete the practical. Note that all
  the preliminary exercises are marked and each will count for 1% of the to
 tal semester grade.\n\nComplete all activities before attending the practi
 cal. This set of exercise can be completed in parts - it is possible to lo
 g out and complete the rest of the exercises later. There is a summary pag
 e at the end showing answers given and a score. It is possible to repeat t
 his set of activities (we will record your best grade). Many questions are
  drawn from a pool and may change slightly on the second attempt.\n\nThis 
 set of exercises is simply a guide - many students will feel the need to u
 ndertake extra research to fully understand the terminology and the concep
 ts required to complete the practical. To be adequately prepared and achie
 ve maximum marks in the practical it is expected that you will:\n\n* Read 
 and understand the practical instructions\, particularly the assessment po
 ints.\n\n* Understand the procedures that will be undertaken during the pr
 actical.\n\nIf you have any issues with this exercise or have found a mist
 ake please don't hesitate to email me: [simon.wells@adelaide.edu.au] (mail

DESCRIPTION:Course Review activities are intended to get you to engage with
  the course material and review your understanding. Most questions can be 
 answered solely with course material although you may find the internet a 
 useful resource.\n\nThis activity consists of 10 questions and is worth 1%
  of your semester grade. Some of these questions will appear in the coming
  MCQ tests. The review activities open on Friday afternoon and are availab
 le for 2 weeks. After this time you will be able to access the activities 
 but can not gain a grade for them.\n\nYou can repeat this activity as many
  times as you like and we will record the highest grade you achieve. Each 
 question is drawn randomly from a small pool of similar questions so will 
 probably change if you attempt the activity again.\n\nI encourage you to u
 se the 'Report' link if you find a question with an issue. Issues include 
 spelling errors\, obsolete questions\, incorrect hints\, or even that you 
 can't understand the question. If you would like to talk to me about speci
 fic questions I'm happy to see you at the Drop-In Centre or just send me a
 n email and I'll get back to you as soon as possible: simon.wells@adelaide
